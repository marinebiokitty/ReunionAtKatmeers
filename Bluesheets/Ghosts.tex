\name{\bGhosts{}}

The souls of the dead usually wind up in the Shadow Realm, but rage, hatred, or another strong emotion keeps a few of them chained to the physical world.  As the passion dissipates over time, the ghost may likewise fade, and eventually move to the Shadow Realm where they belong.  Ghosts carry lanterns which contain their tormented souls.  They are immune to all damage; however, a person wielding an empty bottle can trap them inside it.
