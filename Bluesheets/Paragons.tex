\name{\bParagons{}}

The Paragons are three relics of immeasurable power, representing Power, Wisdom, and Courage, respectively.  They normally lie in a hidden temple, waiting for someone who holds all three virtues in balance to recover them.  If such a person finds them, and unites them at the stroke of midnight, that person is granted the thing they wish for the most.  The Paragons then split, vanish and move to a new sanctum.  If a person who does not hold all three virtues in balance finds them, they split instead, with the wish ungranted.  The finder would be left with the Paragon that most aligned with them, while the other two fragments would find new, suitable Wielders. Once the Paragons have split in this way, the wish will be granted to the first person who is able to gain possession of all three shards and unite them at midnight.
