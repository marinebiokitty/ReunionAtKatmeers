These playful sprites are normally found in hidden fountains, where they often offer aid to adventurers who wander by.  Adventurers sometimes catch them in bottles, which legend holds forms an unofficial contract - if the adventurer is in need of healing, they will release the fairy, and the grateful sprite will heal them before departing for their fountain.  You are aware that the bottle is a superfluous prison; the fairy may choose to heal the adventurer any time she is free, and it is the act of healing that pulls her back to the fountain.  Fae magic is strange and illogical like that.
