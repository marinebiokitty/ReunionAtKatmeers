You know how to pick pockets.

*The GM will provide you with a sheet of stickers before game for this mechanic*

In order to successfully pick pocket someone, you must stick at least one sticker on them without their noticing. More stickers allow you to steal items of greater value and/or metaphysical connection to the current owner. You do not know exactly how many stickers it will take to get any particular item. (Items that are labeled ``Hard to Steal'' will definitely require more than one sticker) Once you have successfully stuck a sticker (or stickers) on someone, tell a GM, and they will facilitate getting the item to you. (This is so your target does not have any idea why they are losing the item.)

You can attempt to steal a {\bf random} item, steal a {\bf specific} item, or sneak an item {\bf into} someone's pocket. If you want a specific item, describe it to the GM. If you just want something random, tell a GM. If you want to sneak an item into someone's pocket, give the item to a GM. In either case, once you have stuck a sticker(s) on your target, come talk to a GM.

{\bf If your target catches you sticking a sticker on them} you must tell them that they caught you attempting to pick-pocket them.
